**TestCrew AI** is an intelligent platform designed to provide GATE CSE aspirants with a limitless supply of high-quality, unique practice questions. It moves beyond static question banks by generating complex, GATE-style questions in real-time, tailored to specific subjects or a full-syllabus mock test format.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **ü§ñ Real-Time Question Generation:** Creates fresh questions on demand for any topic in the GATE CSE syllabus.
- **ü§ù Multi-Agent Architecture:** Inspired by CrewAI, it uses a "Peer-Review Panel" of specialized AI agents to ensure every question is complex, accurate, and unambiguous.
- **üéØ Topic & Full-Syllabus Tests:** Generate a focused practice test for a specific topic or a full-fledged mock test that mirrors the GATE exam's subject distribution.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Guaranteed Uniqueness:** Utilizes a RAG system with a vector database (ChromaDB) to check for semantic similarity, ensuring generated questions are unique.
- **üíª Immersive Exam UI:** A clean, professional interface with a live countdown timer and a question navigation palette provides an authentic, distraction-free exam experience.
- **üìà Performance Analytics:** Automatically tracks your test history, allowing you to monitor your progress over time.
- **üîç Searchable Question Bank:** All generated questions are saved and can be searched, allowing you to review specific concepts.
- **üîí Local & Private:** Runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama, ensuring your data and usage are private.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The system's core is a **Peer-Review Panel** where multiple AI agents collaborate to create and validate each question. This mimics the rigorous process of an academic exam committee.

1.  **Topic Analysis Agent (Decomposer):** Breaks down a high-level topic into specific, researchable sub-concepts.
2.  **Research Agent (Researcher):** Gathers rich, academic-quality context for a specific sub-concept.
3.  **Question Drafting Agent (Drafter):** Creates a draft GATE-level question (MCQ, MSQ, or NAT) from the context.
4.  **Critique Agent (Critic):** Ruthlessly reviews the draft for any flaws, such as ambiguity or factual errors.
5.  **Refinement Agent (Refiner):** Rewrites the question based on the critique to produce a final, polished, exam-ready version.

  ```bash
  ollama pull deepseek-llm:7b-chat
  ```

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/testcrew-ai.git
    cd testcrew-ai
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **macOS / Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application should now be open and running in your web browser\!
