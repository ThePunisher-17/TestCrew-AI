**An advanced, AI-powered exam generation system for GATE Computer Science (CSE) using a multi-agent architecture.**

TestCrew AI is an intelligent platform designed to provide GATE CSE aspirants with a limitless supply of high-quality, unique practice questions. It moves beyond static question banks by generating complex, GATE-style questions in real-time, tailored to specific subjects or a full-syllabus mock test format.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Real-Time Question Generation:** Creates fresh questions on demand for any topic in the GATE CSE syllabus.
  * **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Inspired by CrewAI, it uses a "Peer-Review Panel" of specialized AI agents (Decomposer, Researcher, Drafter, Critic, Refiner) to ensure every question is complex, accurate, and unambiguous.
  * **Topic & Full-Syllabus Tests:** Generate a focused practice test for a specific topic or a full-fledged mock test that mirrors the GATE exam's subject distribution.
  * **Guaranteed Uniqueness:** Utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with a vector database (ChromaDB) to check for semantic similarity, ensuring generated questions are unique.
  * **Immersive Exam UI:** A clean, professional interface with a live countdown timer and a question navigation palette provides an authentic, distraction-free exam experience.
  * **Performance Analytics:** Automatically tracks your test history, allowing you to monitor your progress over time.
  * **Searchable Question Bank:** All generated questions are saved and can be searched, allowing you to review specific concepts.
  * **Local & Private:** Runs entirely on your local machine using Ollama, ensuring your data and usage are private.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview

The system's core is a **Peer-Review Panel** where multiple AI agents collaborate to create and validate each question. This mimics the rigorous process of an academic exam committee.

1.  **Topic Analysis Agent (Academic Decomposer):** Receives a high-level topic (e.g., "Operating System") and breaks it down into specific, researchable sub-concepts (e.g., "Deadlock Prevention").
2.  **Research Agent (Diligent Researcher):** Gathers rich, academic-quality context for a specific sub-concept.
3.  **Question Drafting Agent (Junior Professor):** Creates a draft GATE-level question (MCQ, MSQ, or NAT) strictly from the provided context.
4.  **Critique Agent (Senior Moderator):** Ruthlessly reviews the draft for any flaws, such as ambiguity, factual errors, or poor-quality options.
5.  **Refinement Agent (Editor-in-Chief):** Rewrites the question based on the critique to produce a final, polished, exam-ready version.

This pipeline ensures a high standard of quality for every single question generated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get TestCrew AI running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+**
  * **Ollama:** Make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.
  * **A Local LLM:** Pull a capable instruction-tuned model. We recommend `deepseek-llm:7b-chat`.
    ```bash
    ollama pull deepseek-llm:7b-chat
    ```

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the source code):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/testcrew-ai.git
    cd testcrew-ai
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
